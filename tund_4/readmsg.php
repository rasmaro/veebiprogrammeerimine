   <p> Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.<br /> Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.<br />You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! <br />I mean, if I went around saying I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!</p>
